        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Pelmeni are dumplings of Russian cuisine that consist of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened dough. The debate about the exact place of origin is still active, with Ural and Siberia both maintaining strong claims.</p>
        <p>Pelmeni have been described as "the heart of Russian cuisine".</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300 g flour</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>200 ml water</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>150 g ground beef</li>
            <li>150 g ground pork</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>100 g sour cream</li>
            <li>dill (for serving)</li>
            <li>flour (for dusting)</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a fine sieve to sift flour into a large bowl. Add salt, then use a spoon to make a well in the center of the flour and crack in the egg. Use a fork to whisk the egg into the flour. While whisking, gradually add water until you have a sticky dough. Use your hands to fully integrate any remaining flour into the dough. Transfer dough to a floured work surface, knead until smooth, approx. 3-5 min. Transfer dough back to the bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for approx. 30 min.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prepare the filling. Peel and quarter onions. Add onions and peeled garlic cloves to a food processor and blend into a paste. Add ground beef and pork to a large bowl, add onion and garlic paste, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer rested dough to a floured work surface. Divide the dough into four pieces and roll out each with a rolling pin on a floured work surface.</li>
            <li>Use a round cookie cutter or glass to cut out rounds of dough. Add approx. 1 tsp of the meat filling to the center of each round of dough. Use your hands to fold the circles into a half moon shape, pinching the edges closed. Then, bring the corners together and pinch to close the pelmeni. Repeat with all the dough and filling.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add bay leaves and season with salt. Cook the pelmeni in batches for approx. 5 min., or until they float. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately with sour cream and dill. Enjoy!</li>
